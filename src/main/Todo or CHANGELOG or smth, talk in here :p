# TODO!
## Fix Hunter's Glass invis (chem or vbinnie, idk)
Shadows are inconsistent, armor and whatnot are weird

Yes entity targeting and potion particles should still be there >:<
I cannot remove Enchancement particles so

## Add Judge rebalances (Chem)
Fix the Judge being able to be quickdropped, give them a decent ability, and fix the healthbar being funky
For reference, the healthbar will "remove" hearts past 10 hearts if they aren't full or something? idk how to describe

## Add resheathing to Katanas (Chem)
aka 8 billion recipes to allow people to resheathe them :DDDDDD 
I'll prolly do this today after school (12/10/25)

## Add cosmetics for Judge (Chem or Vbinnie)
Aka making the Judge taller, removing armor rendering, etc.

## Add summoning of **THE COURT** to Court Glass (Chem)
Summons three wither skeletons, one with speed 3 and strength 4, one with health boost like 90 and weakness 1, and one with a bow. All three in iron armor

## Make Blackout ability have a cooldown (Chem)
Make the Blackout ability for the Hunter's Glass have a 30 second cooldown. During the cooldown the invis cannot be used.

## Fix the Blackout sfx being doubled (Chem)
Remove the blackout sfx played by the blackout ability being played twice :p

## (Fixed) Fix the Sculk Katana playing the Blackout sfx (Chem) 
Sculk Katana plays the Blackout sfx
